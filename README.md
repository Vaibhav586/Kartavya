# 🍽️ Kartavya – A B2B Food Redistribution Platform

**Kartavya** is a tech-enabled, not-for-profit platform designed to reduce food waste and fight hunger. It connects restaurants, mess halls, and event venues (with surplus food) to verified NGOs and community kitchens. The platform ensures food is safely redistributed to those in need through intelligent logistics, transparent tracking, and verified users. Developed as a final-year project, Kartavya aligns with the UN Sustainable Development Goals — **SDG #2 (Zero Hunger)**, **SDG #12 (Responsible Consumption and Production)**, and **SDG #13 (Climate Action)**.
